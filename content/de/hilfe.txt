# A big header

## A smaller header

### etc.

For normal text just type away. It will automagically wrap around in the box.
For a normal line break just put two spaces  
at the end.

For a bigger one use two linebreaks like so.

Look, it's easy :-)

One *star* around a word makes it italic.

Two **stars** around a word make it bold.

Three ***stars*** around a word make it bold and italic.

## Lists

*   List item 1

    List item continued
*   List item 2

    For a list item just put a star and press tab.
    
    To have a line break in an item just don't add a star.
    But don't forget to indent the text.

## Numbered Lists

1.  For numbered list just put a number followed by period and a tab.
2.  The same rules for linebreaks apply to numbered lists

    as for unordered lists.
