# About me

My name is Mary O´Keeffe. I grew up on a dairy farm in the south-west of
Ireland. I moved to Germany in the mid 80ies and since then lived in Berlin,
Hessen and Northrhein Westfalia.

It´s always been a pleasure seeing myself as an „inofficial Ambassador of
Ireland“. I´ve been inspired by the interest of the German folk to organise
irish cookery evenings and presentations about Ireland.

Back in Ireland the neighbours say „I never come home without bringing somebody
with me“. This led to the idea of organising group travel for those looking for
an insiders view.
