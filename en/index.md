# Hello,

my name is Mary O'Keeffe and as a native Irish person I'd like to show you my
Ireland – how it vibrates, it´s stunning natural beauty as well as the heart and
soul of the Irish race.

I organise all aspects of your trip from accommodation to getting around, where
to go and what to do. If so wished, I'll even accompany you as personal guide.

Please call or mail me if you are interested or if have any queries about
Ireland.

Regards from Bocholt, Westfalia.

Mary O’Keeffe
